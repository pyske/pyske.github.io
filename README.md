# What is PySke?

Algorithmic skeletons are patterns of parallel computations. Skeletal
parallel programming eases parallel programming: a program is merely
a composition of such patterns. Data-parallel skeletons operate on
parallel data-structures that have often sequential counterparts. In
algorithmic skeleton approaches that offer a global view of programs,
a parallel program has therefore a structure similar to a sequential
program but operates on parallel data-structures. PySke is such an
algorithmic skeleton library for Python to program shared or
distributed memory parallel architectures in a simple way.
